# Shiny App created in R to visualize sales of Superstore data over roughly a 3 year time frame

### App allows the user to look at a Geo_plot, hover over each state, and visualize the total sales and state name.
### App also shows a time series plot, that allows the user to interactively change the trends (days, weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually)
### There is a second page in the app that has tables.  The main table summarises Sales, Profits and Number of Orders grouped by State and the Category of the sale.
### The bottom two tables show the same summaries, but are grouped by State and Subcategory (left table) and by State only (right lower table).

### The app inludes reactive buttons that allows the user to look at both the visualizations and the tables by selecting certain date ranges, categories or sub-categories.
### To reset the app to its default state, simply hit the 'Reset' button in the app.
